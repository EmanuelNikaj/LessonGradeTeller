In this page we can see a program in which we add our lessons
and grades and show us the highest and lowest grade but also where we 
or anyone else has been quilified or disquilied as well.

Also,I want to mention that it was done in greek so wherever you see the word "mathima" is the same like saying "lesson".

This was firstly made in pascal but I got it converted in python language.
